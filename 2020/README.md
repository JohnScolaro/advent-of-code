Here are my solutions for the 25 days of the advent of code 2020!

This was my first ever advent of code, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Before I did these challenges, I would have say I had a high level of proficiency in Python, but through completing them, and comparing answers with others on the web, I learned about several inbuilt modules I'd never heard of, and have easily incorporated them into my work.

The advent of code is a fantastic challenge that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys programming.

To run my solutions, simply run:

```python3 dayXX.py```

from inside that day's directory.
